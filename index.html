    <div class="text">I am a young professional, lover of verbal languages, dogs, tech, and the great outdoors. 
  Growing up in a bilingual household, I've always found excitement in learning more verbal languages to communicate with people and help them with anything they may need. 
  When I was introduced to programming and their languages, I was just as amazed and desired to learn as much as possible.
  A critical thinker, I enjoy being presented with issues that require a solution. In my young developer career, I am ready to provide people with solutions to their problems in business by developing useful websites, apps, and more!
